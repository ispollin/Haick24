# Arabic Sign Language Image Classification

## Overview
Welcome to the **Arabic Sign Language Image Classification** competition!

Sign language is crucial for communication between deaf and hearing individuals. Arabic Sign Language, which uses specific gestures corresponding to the Arabic alphabet, presents an intriguing problem for deep learning-based image classification.

## Objective
In this challenge, you will analyze datasets of Arabic sign language images, each representing a specific letter of the Arabic alphabet. Your goal is to develop predictive models that accurately classify these images into their corresponding letters.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of images of hand gestures representing Arabic letters.
- Each image is labeled with its corresponding Arabic letter.
- Data is split into training and testing sets.

## Approach
1. **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
2. **Model Selection**: CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.).
3. **Training & Evaluation**: Using loss functions and accuracy metrics.
4. **Optimization**: Fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance.



## Results
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Model performance comparison.
- Insights from misclassified images.
